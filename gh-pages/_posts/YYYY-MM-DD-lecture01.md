## Lecture 01

When writing up lecture notes, it's advisable to use either PDFs which embed in markdown files or markdown files directly where you can capture the gist of a lecture and the arguments of a proof without having to do the details. 

Filling in the details of an outline of a proof is a great way to encourage that you retain the information from a lecture.
